# Base documentation style guide

This document is a living, incremental style guide targeted at contributors to the `base` library's documentation. Its first and main purpose is to standardise our current practices when it comes to documentation writing.

This guide is not a language guide on the English language. The writer should refer to the New Oxford Style Manual, the Chicago Manual of Style, or any other professional reference for any concerns pertaining to writing in the English language.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## British vs. American spelling

Being an international community of contributors, many of whom coming from English-speaking countries, there are bound to be different spelling standards living with each-other.  

* If editing an existing document, consistency must be favoured. If the document is inconsistent, an arbitrary spelling can be picked in order to harmonise the document.
* When creating a new document, the kind of spelling should be the one the author(s) are most familiar with, as to avoid potential irregularities.

## Greek letters for types, Latin letters for terms

The usage of "Greek letters for types, Latin letters for terms", whilst in use in some circles, is not as widespread as one may think. In particular, it can be harder for the reader to deal with another alphabet if Latin is not their first one. Moreover, it can potentially come off as pedantic (an image which our community struggles to avoid).  
Thus, this style is discouraged in the GHC documentation.
